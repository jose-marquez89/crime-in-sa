# crime-in-sa
*A data visualization project for my personal professional portfolio*

# In This Repo
The two main components of this project are the ipynb file and 
the python script used to scrape data from the sa.gov UCR report webpage

# The Main Thing
This project addresses the issue of crime in San Antonio, it 
aims to show that although property crime is a definite issue 
in the city, the risk of being affected by violent crime 
appears to be quite low. The project acheives this throught the 
exploration of Uniform Crime Report data and visualizations 
derived from it
